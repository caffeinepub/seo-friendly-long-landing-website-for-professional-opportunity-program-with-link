# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the landing page feel more visually rich by adding additional static, generated images across multiple sections while keeping the warm, professional theme consistent.

**Planned changes:**
- Add four new generated image assets under `frontend/public/assets/generated` using the specified filenames.
- Update `frontend/src/pages/LandingPage.tsx` to render the new images across at least 3 different landing page sections (beyond the existing hero/fees areas) with responsive layout.
- Add descriptive English alt text for all newly added images while keeping existing required poster images unchanged.

**User-visible outcome:** The landing page displays more warm, professional visuals across multiple sections on mobile and desktop without removing or renaming any existing poster/banner images.
